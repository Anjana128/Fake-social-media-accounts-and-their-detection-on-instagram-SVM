Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm using Python. SVM is a powerful supervised learning model used for classification and regression tasks, particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces.


#Features
Implements SVM using Scikit-learn.
Supports linear and non-linear kernels (e.g., RBF, polynomial, sigmoid).
Includes data preprocessing and feature scaling.
Evaluates model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.


#Installation
To run the SVM algorithm, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Alternatively, if using Jupyter Notebook, ensure all required libraries are installed before running the notebook.


#Usage
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the repository:
cd your-repo
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook SVM.ipynb
Run the cells sequentially to execute the SVM algorithm.


#Example
Load a dataset (e.g., Iris dataset, handwritten digits dataset, or any custom dataset).
Preprocess and normalize the data.
Choose an appropriate kernel for the SVM model.
Train and evaluate the model using performance metrics.
